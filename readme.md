###User Stories

**Role**: ages 6 to ~ , mostly people who like brain teasers or logic puzzles and are nerdy about DC superheroes

**Goal**: to combine blocks of the same (superhero) type to the 11th degree. Usually this means until you reach 2048, but in this version it will mean until you create the justice league!

**Reasons**: For logical, SUPER fun game time! Also bragging rights!

###Sprint Planning (MVP)

- *(current)* As a player, I get instructions to play the game. It's themed. I'm told it's the year 2048 and there is a crisis between timelines. I need to help Superman and his friends unite with their altnerate selves in order to form the ultimate timeline Justice League.

- *(current)* As a player, I can use up, down, right and left buttons to move the boxes on the board

- *(current)* As a player, I am alerted when I win (the Justice League has been formed!), how many tries it took me to win and how many moves it took me to win (so I can brag to friends!)

- *(current)* As a player, I can reset the game using a reset button to try again

- *(current)* As a player, I see animated boxes moving across the board (very basic animation) so it looks pleasing and simple

- As a player, I can keep track of how many moves I made this round so I can brag to my friends (if I win in fewer moves)

- As a player, I see buttons with superhero symbols faded in the background, with a number in the foreground so I feel like I'm forming the justice league if I win!

- As a player, I can keep track of how many tries it takes to win the game so I can brag to my friends

- As a player, I can play the game on my cell phone by swipping in any direction. The information from the right hand side moves to the bottom on my cell phone.


###Icebox

- As a player, I see a POP UP when I first load the page. It explains the story behind the game in a short, concise way. On the main page, I can still see simple instructions for the gameplay.

- Instead of using the keyboard, as a player, I have the choice of clicking and swiping (or moving my mouse) in order to move the board 

- As a player, I can see how far I've gotten on screen, because anytime a new superhero appears, he or she is added onto a "Justice League Members" part of my website, which indicates who has joined the justice league

- As a player, I can choose any number 1-9 to start with (or in this case, any superhero!)

- As a player, I can use an undo button (and I am alerted if I won without using undo)

- As a player, I can choose to receive a sheet VIA e-mail with a scoreboard of how quickly I won (again, for bragging rights!)! (or possibly I can post to facebook?)

- As a player, I can create a username and login to keep track of how awesome I am a creating the justice league (local storage)

- As a player, I see more advanced animation when I win

- As a player, I can set a timer (I must make a move in 0:05 seconds or another piece appears!) and I can adjust the amount of seconds between each move

- As a player, I have to memorize where all the boxes are because the boxes on the board flash off after a new box appears. This will make the game more challenging!
